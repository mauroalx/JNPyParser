## What is JNPyParser

JNPyParser is a tool designed to help network analysts convert Juniper device configuration commands into the 'set' configuration mode.

## Why shoud I Use it?

JNPyParser has been tested in various environments and has proven effective, especially when dealing with inactive: and protect: statements or large line configurations. Some available tools fail to handle these cases properly.

## How to Use it?

Simply open main.exe inside the dist/ folder and paste your configuration code. Alternatively, since the tool is open source, you can run it directly from the terminal using the code provided in the top comments of main.py.
